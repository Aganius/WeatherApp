Notes:
- Based on the market share of devices using iOS versions older than 16, I decided to use as a minimum version iOS 14 because of the multiple advantages it brings such as SwiftUI and Combine support and is not worth to keep giving support to an old version of the OS that can bring many Security issues.

- I decided to create the Interface in SwiftUI to show the advantages of using it, although it cannot fully replace UIKit yet it is on a good path to become the best way of doing user interfaces in iOS/MacOS apps.
- The Weather API Provided is not returning more than two days of forecast even if you do the request with the days query set to any number of days, I searched and it is because the free plan don't allow you to obtain it, but the app supports multiple days in advance, as it can be seen in the Mocks that I created.
